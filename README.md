# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is simple game which I try to improve and extend as much as possible. In the future I will try to improve the project 

## TODO

- [x] - designed storyboard and imported assets using Adobe XD
- [x] - implemented basic random bot game choices
- [x] - implemented basic user functionalities (able to play and win/loose - the game will illustrate the result)
- [ ] - implemented winning algorithms for the bot player (with some random possibility of makin a mistake)
- [ ] - implemented other game modes (e.g. 4x4 playground)
- [ ] - implemented ML (so that the bot is able to learn how to win in different game modes
